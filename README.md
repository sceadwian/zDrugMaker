# zDrugMaker
Leo's Preclinical Pharmacology Companion Scripts 

zDrugMaker_v1_0.py - Leo's Dilution Calculator and Volume Conversion Applet v1 - 
Most recent version of the calculator. Can calculate simple formulations, dilutions and can estimate drug requirements for rodent pharmacological studies. This script has an additional functionality of logging all calculations in simple text format with time stamps to make this a great way to keep additional records of your formulations.

zAllocator_v1_0.py - Leo's group allocator script v1 - 
Most recent version of the script used to allocate subjects into well balanced test groups based on a single variable. Input your subject IDs and their respective data (ie. body weight). Select final number of groups to be tested. Outputs into a separate file.

zToggl.py - Parses time tracker export csv file from Toggl - 
Developping a script to parse out hours worked at Lab based on detailed Toggl Time Tracker Output. Work in Progress

zFarseta_v0_1.py - Leo's cypher v1 - 
Simple encryption tool to transform legible digital text into encrypted document which can be decrypted with the same python script. This version can read sections of the document at a time.

zFarseta_v0_2.py - Leo's cypher with + number hiding signature v2 - 
Simple encryption tool to transform legible digital text into encrypted document which can be decrypted with the same python script. This version has additional number scrambling functionality to make the encrypted information more difficult to crack. However, small edits to the output may invalidate the whole text. Text cannot be partially decrypted either.

zFileAnal - File Analysis Script -
Work in progress

# Leo's Preclinical Pharmacology Companion Scripts

Welcome to Leo's Preclinical Pharmacology Companion Scripts! This collection of Python scripts is designed to assist researchers in various tasks related to preclinical pharmacological studies. From calculating dilutions and volume conversions to allocating subjects into balanced test groups, these scripts aim to streamline your workflow and improve efficiency. Additionally, there are tools for parsing time tracker exports and file analysis.

## Scripts

1. **zDrugMaker_v1_0.py** - Leo's Dilution Calculator and Volume Conversion Applet v1: This is the most recent version of the calculator, capable of handling simple formulations, dilutions, and estimating drug requirements for rodent pharmacological studies. It also features a logging functionality to keep records of your formulations with timestamps.

2. **zAllocator_v1_0.py** - Leo's Group Allocator Script v1: This script facilitates the allocation of subjects into well-balanced test groups based on a single variable. You can input subject IDs and their respective data (e.g., body weight) and specify the final number of groups to be tested. The output is saved in a separate file.

3. **zToggl.py** - Toggl Time Tracker Export Parser: Currently a work in progress, this script aims to parse the detailed Toggl Time Tracker export CSV file and extract hours worked at the lab. It provides a convenient way to analyze your time tracking data. Stay tuned for updates!

4. **zFarseta_v0_1.py** - Leo's Cypher v1: This simple encryption tool transforms legible digital text into an encrypted document that can be decrypted using the same Python script. Version 1 allows for reading sections of the encrypted document at a time.

5. **zFarseta_v0_2.py** - Leo's Cypher with Number Hiding Signature v2: Building upon the previous version, this encryption tool includes additional functionality for scrambling numbers, making the encrypted information more challenging to crack. However, please note that small edits to the output may invalidate the entire text, and partial decryption is not possible.

6. **zFileAnal** - File Analysis Script: Currently a work in progress, this script aims to provide file analysis capabilities. Stay tuned for updates on this exciting feature!
